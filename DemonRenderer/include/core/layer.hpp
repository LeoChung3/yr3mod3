/**
\class Layer
\brief A convient abstraction of rendering and events into a layer which can be placed in the application.
Intended for use as a base class. onRender and onUpdate must be implemented, thats why they are pure virtual functions.
Event handling is optional, it is possible to just use the event handler some user input and other action may not be required.
ImGUI renderering is also optional.
